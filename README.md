# **Unit 4 Homeowork: Pandas**
### *This is a read me file for homework 4*

## `Performance Analysis:`
I first reading the 3 files provided and combining them into a dataframe called *combined_df*. After sorting and cleaning the dataframe I plot the combined dataframe and it appears that **TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC** may have the most variablity. 

However, after plotting the box plot of each peortfolio we can see that **TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC** has the farthest outliers but isnt neccesaryily the most risky portfolio. The caluculation of the standard deviation of the combined dataframe shows that **BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC** is actually the most risky portfolio since it has the largest standard deviation. The order of the most risky to least risky portfolio goes as follows:

>`BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC; TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC; S&P 500;
Algo 2; SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT LLC; Algo 1; PAULSON & CO.INC.`
